# TM1680MatrixGFX
Arduino library for LED Matrices using the TM1680 LED driver. Uses the [Adafruit GFX library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library) to support easy to use drawing functions. First release limited to BTL-350 TM1680 RGB LED matrix.

## Features & limitations
- This first release only supports the TM1680 RGB LED matrix that is found in the BTL-350 bluetooth speaker by Denver. Future releases may have a generic TM1680 base class and matrix module specific derived classes.

## Examples
See the [library examples](/examples) for more information on how to use this library.
